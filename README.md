# push_swap_guilletester

Welcome to push_swap_guilletester. A tester made with love by gumoreno, me :) to help improve your 42 project “push_swap” :)

Clone the repo into your push_swap folder (at the same level of your Makefile) and enter it. 

There you will find three executable files:

   ./push_swap_tester   --> You can run your push_swap on multiple ramdom combinations of numbers and test its limits and if it sorts correctly. 
        
   ./push_swap_parser   --> Test if it is handling input arguments correctly. 

   ./push_swap_eval     --> A battery of different tests will be run on your push_swap project. 

You can find several flags to be used in each of the executable files. Check it with the --help flag. 
       
Enjoy it! :)
